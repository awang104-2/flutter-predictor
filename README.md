Flutter Prediction of a Rigid Airfoil Using Theodorsen’s Theory

End-to-end aeroelastic model that implements Theodorsen’s theory to find the flutter speed and flutter frequency of a rigid airfoil. As described by Theodorsen’s theory, the airfoil in question will be defined by purely harmonic motion for both pitch and plunge. 
Implements Broyden’s root finding method to solve for the flutter speed (𝑈𝑓 ) and flutter frequency (𝜔𝑓 ) by leveraging the aerodynamic condition that the determinant must be zero.
